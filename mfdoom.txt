Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take "Means to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac
On Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get dentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!
Doomsday
Check the sound
Right around
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel you MC]
Yo! 
MF DOOM 
Mr. Fantastik 
What up, nigga? 
What's cracking, boy? 
Man 
These rap snitches, man, shit is bugged out, man
What the fuck, man? 
Niggas running their mouth, telling e'rything, e'rything 
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Type profile low, like A in Paid in Full
Attract heavy cash cause the game's centrifugal
Mr. Fantastik, long dough like elastic
Guard my life with twin Glocks that's made out of plastic
Can't stand a brown nosing nigga, fake ass bastard
Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan
Plotting, plan the quickest, my flow's the sickest
My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin
Play a fake gangsta like a old accordion
According to him, when the D's rushed in
Complication from the wire, testimony was thin
Caused his man to go up north, the ball hit 'em again
Lame rap snitch nigga even told on the Mexican
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
Rap snitches, telling all their business
Sit in the court and be their own star witness
Do you see the perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here
Fuck around, get the whole label sent up for years
True, there's rules to this shit, fools dare care
Everybody wanna rule the world with tears for fear
Yeah, yeah, tell 'em tell it on the mountain hill
Running up they mouth bill, everybody doubting still
Informer, keep it up and get tested
Pop through your bubble vest or double-breasted
He keep a lab down south in the little beast
So much heat you woulda thought it was the Middle East
A little grease always keeps the wheels a-spinning
Like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men
Where no brains but gum flap
He said his gun clap, then he fled after one slap 
Son, shut your trap, save it for the bitches
Mmm, delicious, rapp snitch knishes
]
You know what I'm saying? 
Crazy, man, I'm just analyzing this whole game
This is bugged out, man, niggas is snitching
Telling on they own self 
Fuck around and get everybody bagged, man
 Fuck around and get yo mama bagged, nigga
You know your grandmama used to be bootlegging
Fake hustling nigga, heheheheh, haha
Perpetrator? Yeah, I'm right here... 
I strive to be humble, lest I stumble
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust
Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up
Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders
What, these old things? About to throw 'em away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ
Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay
MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?
Working on a way that we can roll away tinted
Some say the price of holding heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
 A lot of niggas wish to die
They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry
You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat
I coulda had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side, it won't get blistered
Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding 
When I was four, I penned "God Was Born In New York"
Back in '77, still got nan in the crescent
The effervescence of God's presence is thick
Unlike vapor, Esther Rolle, extra raw, word to the baker
Peace to the hardworkin' gingerbread makers
Looked her up and down said, "Hmm, too much makeup"
Poor music taste, ten years from being grown up
Rappers don't blow up, heads do 
My name is Dwight Spitz, I'mma Sonic addict
I use to think it was merely a nagging habit
Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it into fine wine
Barely born a virgin is what the stars said
Black not white, red all over though like Elmo
Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love
I get mad love but I detest the labor
And its wages, you know death
I'm servin' life from this gift of God
Don't forget your potholders, my niggas 
A short time laterVillain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his galoshes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed to know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough, it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
For 10 K's, he'll cave a chicken chest S
Yes... y'all, the dub will get ya trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
But tut tut, he 'bout to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have 'em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' 'til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah, ya boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, "Firing pins was separate"
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance to translate it and ignored it sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie wanna cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still, there's no thrill
Fill a billion 10K bills in his pill'a
Villa', when it gets realer, split the skrilla with-
Dilla  mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet'cha bottom nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick come with the dumb shtick
Sick slick, hidden in a book
The only way they find it if you're spittin' in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men stalkin' hear that we hawkin' often
Coughin' to a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Worf, some say stronger though
Off the top, Jay Strongbow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo, off The Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
A actress and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray J, the old tape
DOOM—well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake
My mistake, sign a track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event, it's fake like wrestlin'
Get 'em like Jake The Snake on mescalines
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note, Villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his Ph.D in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain—his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who do a duet jam when Ernest goes to camp
For the right earn, kna'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets
He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Son's fanbase know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding! Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
Instead, it was depicted as flicked in
Split, the wicks lit 
We have got to try and find DOOM!
Good luck!Darker than the East river, larger than the Empire State
Where the beast who guard the barbed wire gate
Is on the job—not my fate, tired of the wait
'Til the Villain bring deliverance from the dire straits
Fire at a higher rate, why debate the liars?
Fliers scatter, buy a plate—isolate the wires
Try the straight pliers, if not—the vice grips
A real price-saver way to acquire nice whips
What a steal for real on wheels of steel
Stunner, a funner summer number-one meal deal-bummer
A bizarre phenomenon—is your armor on?
Take your cash, Karma, or break your fast—Ramadan
Transaction drama—aw, come on, Barney
Clack, clack—pardon me, whack rap con carne
He came to feed the childrens like Sally Struthers
After that, he's going back to Cali, where's the—
Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids
Of Giza, and stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza
Raw with the pen, and on the mic—off the hezza
Get shot off that wide-eyed talk
And if he had a pot—he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street-person
Lookin' for the perfect beat, coercion into heat-burstin'
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that come with a free hot-plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3 D-ring, sittin' stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting—it ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus
Me and Sub' is like the brown Smothers Brothers 
Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know, fill 'em in tomorrow
On the horror show, a mental note: return Bob’s record
Swear to God, before he gets a job, he robs Eckerd
Blessed with a hot flow—tested—it got dough
Invested in stress, the best to finesse an opto
As I reminisce, never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight, couldn't afford to cop the Cherry Coke
Or should I say, broke with wealth?
To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self
Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog-gone it—do the statistics
How he bust lyrics—it's too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc, the hip-hop Hendrix
"In my pocket, a note. 
It's—from my father."
"—from the guard's whip. Is this a trick?
Why would I resort to trickery? You're already a prisoner. What do I gain by deceiving you?
You can't blame me for being suspicious."
"No."
HeheBy the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy-pop
In a instant get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Ho's get ripped off like Nicorette patch
In real life the real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle, dead up setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
The unemotional call me anti-social
On the run off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps G.M., MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin on my floor or delivery front door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers master yours
My disaster cause: Hell... in gas drawls
The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillins
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Dont make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin in my dealings 
Sendin spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen'
Holdin, foldin the pal
Known as massive-versatile
I’d like to big-em-up Monsta Isle
Uummm, Yeah
I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Mhm
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju
I crack brew for, two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When giving crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss or motherfuckin' mother goose
X the suspicious flirter
Who every hooker hearda', next to malicious murda'
A track type vicious fulfillin the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve don't breathe
Sixteen shots I do believe and one up the sleeve
Master of the O who predict ya last pause
I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls
Breakin glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret war wit' them Fantastic Four 
Versus Doom wit' the metal face before I go to state
The ho better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas is froze like icicles 
And baggin' bitches like nickels
Cause I licked 'em where they tickle before I hit the clit though
I'ma split till I pronounce More hits than a ounce no doubt
About ta bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out
And I like to give a shoutout to the brother Jet Jaguar
Megalon and King Geedorah
I call this joint right here Gas Drawls
In Hell with yours: Running desperately low on food, they were forced to turn back
: Well I'll be!
: What's that villain doing?
: Princess, your voice sounds familiar
: Well it should. You see, DOOM wants me to marry him. But after seeing what he has done to our peaceful world, I despise him. He intends to destroy all of us if I persist in refusing him, even now
Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves, controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see
Holding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife
I shoulda deaded it from genesis instead of hittin' the Guinnesses
Now I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling
He ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling
So deep all in, I bet he never stop balling women
Forsake God for the sin of a man
Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?
Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment
Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it
Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke
Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats
Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?
Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife
Constant frustration, stemming from a no-win situation
Rushing lust and fornication adding to the complication
Patience is a virtue, pain run deep when love desert you
Listenin' to whisperin', choosing chaos over discipline
Simpleton, life should really be a piece of Entenmann’s
Relationships strengthening, flower essence: Penstemon
Gentlemen, my favorite shit, so I've never forsaken it
I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it
Taking sips off a fifth of it, passionate, intense
Incense candles lit, scandalous
Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this?
Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife
: Oh boy here we go!
: How come all you college boys wear them faggotty-looking white shoes, they look funny as hell. Ah looks like she got burnt laces
: You didn't wash your neck. Sometimes we don't wash our necks, but that's ok
: Oh I washed my neck. Take-take a look at my neck
: Hold it right there you!
: Where you are going, there are no jokes
: I'm beginning to think that armor plated Gargoyle doesn't like meMmm
Ladies
My favorite ladies
Mary—you make me wanna eat you
Every time I see you, it's like the first time I meet you
Fragrance like a flower—subtle and sweet too
Seductive and whatever, it might as well be see-through
Like my genie in a bottle
Miss could get me rich look like a magaziney model
Before you know it, he have her on a stroll
Fresh and ripe, complexion like Acapulco Gold
If I had to guess, just right, not a day old
Like a cradle robber, copped her off, shop a trailer-load 
Know the right number, you can get her
And hit it while you would've sold to the highest bidder, like
Fruits and berries, bring daddy loot in a hurry
Just be cute, and don't worry
Type to make a nigga hallucinate and admit it
Then she started losing weight and letting everybody hit it 
Unlike Ally—sometimes she get bitter
Always kept me happy, never had a problem with her
She used to let me use her, back when I was looser
Respect her until to this day and never did abuse her
I told her I'll be faithful, but she don't believe me
I probably could've been, if I'd never met Evie
She make me feel all fuzzy inside, it's loco
You won't get nowheres near her if you're broke though
Kept a shorty mad fine 'n' much thinner
If caught, I get mad time just for touchin' her
Knock wood, so much for hymens
So fly, she should be in the sky with diamonds 
Little young thing, she liked to do the tongue thing
At times she would play hard to get, fronting
Or something, she made me feel like the number one king
Run into her now, and we still catch a fun fling
Met her out in Central Park, that's one sign
Had the God mentally sparked, reflecting sunshine
She said, "You need to stop messing with that white girl
She fuckin' with your head and got your heart in a tight curl" 
We messed around once or twice, but she don't know me
She helped me get money at the dunce price OT
Plus she from Colombia, so she really Spanish
Cookie known to make a cat bank account vanish 
And Miss Hazy; older woman, mature, Black
Every time she sees me, I end up gettin' towed back
All she want me to do is blaze it crazy
The only one complaint is that she make me too lazy
Sugar-mommy laced me with the butter navy Avi
Just her way to make up for the headaches that she gave me
It's all gravy, when I'm done getting my mack on
Ally is always there to help me get back on
Mmm
Ladies
My favorite ladiesYou know when you're gonna come in?
Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know
Because the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit!
Niggas'll never run out of shit!
So much shit, so much scripts through here, niggas never run out of shit...
Enjoy the roller coaster ride
Walk the path of Jesus, witness if Hell freezes
The mind teases reality, crack the pieces
Nothing eases; being chastise with blood baptize
Guys revise, acknowledge past lives
Statements will be made, acknowledge me 
My mind is Heaven's gate so enter me 
My mind is the gate to Hell, so try to flee 
Both gates look the same, which will it be?
Demons scream from thought process
Enter semen, child born, stress
Body want to sleep but the mind can't rest
Measure pleasure through financial progress
When it come to currency, love is nonexistent
Foes multiply, friends become so distant
Some hope you die, backstab in an instant
Foes I despise, disguised as allies
To sabotage, camouflage, loyalty is lies
To see God, look into my eyes
To see the Devil, then you look into my eyes
Cause I'ma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat it up
Speed it up, slow it up, speed it up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Take air, compress it, bless it, mix loops like Ku Klux
MF don't give two fucks
Nigga, quarterback blitz, popped, quickly fumble
Leave game with concussion, seeing stars and mumbles
This happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
Dynasties destroyed like Carringtons and Colbys
Noise, reduced, MF thinks in Dolby
Chop that ass in half like Obi-Wan Kenobi
Greatest of all time, God straight up told me
Greatest of all time, the Devil even told me
Icicles on surfaces of sun, we livin' coldly
Prophets be phony
And we attack, we switch like the Wu-Tang symbol
Still kill Jack even though quick and nimble, plain and simple
Pick niggas off while they ballin'
And die old like Stalin
Yes, Death, I hear you callin', I accept collect
Human sacrifice, must pay respect
We catch reck, nigga, we catch reck
And, we gonna, gonna
Cause I'ma slow it up, speed it up, slow it up, speed it up
Metal Fingers feed beats, Grimm Reaper eat 'em up
Speed 'em up, slow 'em up, speed 'em up, slow it up
Brainsick, tick, tick, tick, MF blow it up
Boom
MF Grimm, MF DOOMAs the life cycle goes on ... goes on
And you learn to hold on 
To things like the mic ... the mic
And you learn to appreciate who is the nicest on said device
But who is 
Tommy Tashuma, too much drama, blind behind the rumor
Time and time and time, my mind, I'm trying to find a tumor
Tommy Tashuma, no time for humor
As soon as one of ya' men's dead in Hempstead
You trying to find Pumas
Sooner the better, even knitted a sweater already
Keep your leather, we coming through the brutal weather
We ready to do whatever, yo' Doom you with it?
You know it like a poet, my brother
Hey, Gunn you wit it? Whatever... 
I know about going paid to broke, to next day well-off
To bust a shell off, to dick-riders: "Get the hell off"
Made a call to a client, he must've had his cell off
A show-off, he has the same bike Puff fell off
I tell off the bat, from science to pure facts
Which niggas is wack 'til they last two tracks
Matter fact, y'all could wait for the rep to tell
The tall-tale, how he escape from out the depths of hell
When die, he gon' die like a soldier die:
Holding a swollen eye, drinking Olde Gold
Smoking a stog, watching po-po patrol the beach
Blowing my high, rolling by, when Gunn die
He gon' try to preach the streets then go to the sky
Yup! That hold water, like drizzle in a paper cup
This one etched in stone, the chisel with the paper up
I need a cut: a taper-up, edge-up
Niggas can't measure up, I'm here to get the treasure up
Stands up and hold 'em high, do or die
He got heat, no surprise, stop the beat, close your eyes
Got the weed, rolling lah
Not sweet, so no demise, all the guys drops seeds so multiply
Within the prophecies hold the lie
He bled my mother and my father, but can't bleed me, OD
Ghetto misery, he bled my brother, my sister, but can't bleed me
A OG, ghetto misery, bled my mother, my father, but can't bleed me
Sci-Fly, whole style stuck up
Used to talk to myself, I told him, "Shut the fuck up!"
Buckle up, cause it's about to be rough
He said, "Keep talking that shit, you 'bout to be snuffed"
Then we squashed it, I let em know: "Watch it --
We only met a time to join these rhymers in the mosh pit"
Gosh, it feels great just to increase the chance
For a pussy nigga face to hit the dance floor
I pull ya' top up, got clout, crack rock, what?
Now it's all good business, and so this bitch is locked up
On the dance floor: you got knocked out, your bitch got knocked up
Baby-face, and hey can you brand you, brand new machete
Damn, I just shook your hand and can't stand you already
Can't stand you, understand you deadly
But my hammer's like a band, my man, it's Brand New and Heavy
Yo' DOOM, you ready?
Yeah! Yo' Gunn, you with it?
Whatever
Come on stay, I wrote this rhyme on my born-day
Remind me of the same style I flipped on "Hey!"
Yikes! Who can fuck with the likes
Of one such who scores touchdown and spikes mic's
Metal grill, with many styles, better still
Feel like number 26 on a roulette wheel
And deal, and run rings around rhymers
And run rings like number runners whose old-timers
Shorty in the all black, she think she all that
I called her, she said, "Don't call back!"
She called me, now what you call that?
Let's go back, I sold crack
Hold gats, smoke that, drink that, toke that
Fuck! Where that ho at? Where that dough at?
Suffering succotash! This hooker broke into his last buck of cash
He love her, motherfuck her ass
Metal feet dented your car fender
My agenda up in the basement party tipping the bartender
Is unbeknownst to you -- who could get body blown?
MF like Mike Fran Corleone
And got it sown, maricon, like to know what you staring at?
An invisible cat, who pull off a disappearing act
Raised by a pack a wild womens like Sweetback
Front? I'mma be back! 
Like niggas in the streets act 
Of black misery
The finestGood evening, ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening
Let me know if y'all with me, y'all
Just a couple of things I wanna say
I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase:
With more rhymes than there's ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian
He wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor, chillin'
Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that
Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record; this is some shit I just thought of, y'all
Science fiction that's not admissible  in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop—to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listamint
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell—
—tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three
Shots from the black bat got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock
She told me, "Get off," I said, "Bitch!
Let me set this shit off so I can get rich right quick"
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga, come out and rock this nation like  ox defacin'
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin' and it sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens, and more of they friends 
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of Becks to triple X?
He just came in 4-D: Follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh, snap!
It seems you walked into a trap, through rap
Zoinks!
This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move, and get broke off like end of Phillies
True believers
Ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin' off two gages with my cape on wrong
Son, it's on, remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me, y'all! 
National and geographic down to the titty-bar
Rep Monster Island City, y'all!
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettlin' bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them
Meddlin' kids!
"Hey!"
"Hey!"If you're waiting for a parade, there ain't none
Sharpen up your spirit of adventure, the fabulous gay way
Hey, what's the big idea? 
I have no ideas, in fact, I'm quite bewildered
Now don't get gay with me
Now listen and keep your shirt on
Grown men in a rubber suit, runnin' around with a young boy
Oh shoot, get a load of that fruit
In thigh-high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit
 Even the rats know it’s tacky
"You ever see me slippin' like that bitch, just smack me"
Posin' Chester, legs open, couldn’t stand worse
All was missin' was a bandana and a man purse
Cryin', dyin', laughin' 'til glands burst
Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding-ass ran first
Fixin' baby hair, messed up wavy curl
Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl
The things some people‘ll do for fame
It’s an herb, it’s a lame, it's, a Goddamn shame
Villain willing when them cold streets call
You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs
Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty
He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry
Turn dirt to dollars like Don Henley
Ugly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy
At least monetarily terribly
MC's need therapy, it’s like a fairy spree
Hit him with a kryptonite brick 
Children come and prick his dead body with a stick
Wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick
She had the tightest grip around the head of my
How much money you got?
I ain't got but four dollars on me
Damn
Anyway I don't got this whole  for ya
Shit, you must be some kind of faggot man
My partner a faggot, why don't you come on out here man?
Man, what the hell?
...Bic, now can I get my pen back
Got no enemy, got no friend, black
With the Green Goblin got the Batcave robbed
Bust in Batman’s head bobbin’, slobbin’ Robin’s knob
Y'all already got your belts on the floor so
Kick them shits over here and click off the porno
Alfred come home, and found them both naked
Handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected
Red and chrome Batmobile, wheelin‘ and dealin’
Aquaman's sleepin' with the fishes for real for squealin’
Psst! The lo-lo on a seal skin blazer
It’s just a little graze from a razor-thin laser
Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players
Showin' off they titballs to all the free-gayers
It’s like a leotard fest
How it got started is any retard's guess
Regardless, that’s they choice, no hate debate
Becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight
And raise the monster rate in the whole population
It’s starting to affect the super pimpin' occupation
Now who’s the hater? Headline the newspaper
Fate of a fake you out caped crusader
Tied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail
Rap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail
The man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male
Sucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale
Told 'em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt
Did it like the dirty drawls, wet ‘em up and air it out
You got any money? 
Listen, you got any money?
Man you goin' crazy? What the hell for?
Four dollars only, damn
Batman's gay Things take a turn for the worse
Send him back where he came from
We got shots fired down the street
Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then- 
Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy Federales, yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home, your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice, bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stresses
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood 
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cageMmmm!
The flow is toe in, precision as an afro trim
All big letters but isn't no acronym
Smack the thin grin off a chin for crack smoking
DDT the first bar, leave this track back broken
Chrome grown men doing business with Anglo-Sax and them
Lacking swing but that banjo's so relaxing
As the wax spin, hacking axes in the wind
Pretend it's just a pen, see if you can pencil 'em in
Tense, mention men of honor fenced in
Census is tens, the wheels fall off then it's the end
Don't get keelhauled in
Villain always been, feel real genuine ballskin
Not to call the whole crowd out
It's just a few chumps, and you know who you are like a shoutout
Place 'em in your loud mouth and taste 'em like a pastry
Waste of space face hastily bow out gracefully
Disappear, reappear and disappear again
Villain not his hair, he's no Afro-American
If that's the case, he'd be a bald-headed African
Taking all the credit and jetted, astral traveling
Turn a man into a mannequin for AFLAC'n
And being tough actin' Tinactin bluff jacking
He wears a mask so when he dogs his face
Each and every race, could absorb the bass
In the place to be, don't believe the hyperbole
It's like a murder spree, get sniped verbally
Or beat in the head with lead pipe languages
For street cred, leave him for dead in anguishments
The slang suggest it was the guy in the glasses
Who came to help the people with they minds in they asses
You set trip and get a grip like Spalding
These walls is thin, feel genuine ballskin"Break out the fine—"
"Villain!"
I warm it up like Kane in his prime
Fuck with us, you insane in the mind
You cowards way out of line
Money talk, boy you wastin' my time
You don't want to put the work in
You just want a taste of the shine
Real talk, so it's hard to trust
I'm in it for the long ride, like I drive a charter bus
Scars and blood, from the deadly bars I bust
In Czar we trust, the army buy they bombs off us
Blog about it naysayer, you can hardly doubt it
Who's the best? Who's the worst? We could argue hours
Runnin' through soldier field, I'm Jordan Howard
Nowadays they respect money more than power
Money, power, respect, we all want some
I ain't waitin', I needed it, one lump sum
Made men trade hands with young guns
They stopped manufacturin' the cloth that I'm cut from
I be laughin' at the beef as though I'm body-shamin' exes
Only time you set-trip is when you binge on Netflix
Reckless, runnin' up like, "Eso, listen please"
Alright I like the beat except the snare, kick and keys
Geez, I teach but I kill them when the class on
So I got no pupils like Spidey with the mask on
Generally speaking, each rhyme is five star
Split personality, I ride with a side car
I can't think of the rhyme, it must be misplaced
It's on the tip of my tongue like Stan Smith's face
Hold on - hmm, something 'bout a fly sound
And how you got no bars like a dry town, so pipe down
The beat bumps like bad skin
"Captain gonna teach stuff", shout to Kraglin that's the line, yo
Let the mind take you where the cameras can't
It's very necessary like a Q-Tip Grammy rant
DOOM's jet lagged, good afternoon or is that night?
Militants speak proper, some airheads said he act white
Catch flight, bread good so he tends to pack light
Got jokes, but usually don't engage in no snap fight
Could be considered a waste confrontin' snakes on the back bite
Detrimental to culture that they lack sight, ass-wipe
Catch him on stage, mad hype, with a trashed mic
Month later, in the gutter, glass pipe and a flashlight
Lookin' 'round for something, he still scurry
Bewilder, incite riots, the mind's gone blurry
There wasn't really shit to say, much to they chagrin or dismay
The licks had 'em on the ropes, then he made a big mistake and hit the hay
Went home and hit the day
Burn the midnight oil and freak the shit a different way
Disaster, time is a component
Settin' fire to rappers in a monumental moment
And the game's potent, it's like a never-ending quotient
A minute ago it was smiles and hugs, now where the fuck the dough went?
He so bent it's like he set the shit straight again
Bombs finna drop and he ain't even close to sayin' when
 Nothin' ever stolen
Was given as a blessin', think the Universe owe him
Got faith in the vessel but know when to keep rowin'
Yeah and get up out your own way when deliverin' a poem
Those who think they do, don't know him
No different than a squad of birds ready to blow him
Sorry Charlie, get back up on your Harley
Win, lose or draw, plus beat you at Atari
Drop they ass deep in some far-off Safari
And prob'ly even got the answer to, "Who the hell are we?"
Metal Face squad drone, tell the real ones, "Shalom"
In a calm tone, bomb thrownChain-smoking beedies 'til his brain's broken completely
Get back on his feet, work out and eat some Wheaties
Greedy for the cheese, please, most couldn't fathom
Had him in the cobra clutch, when he spat the mad hymn
Gems, collection of brrrats Timbs and hats
Had no time for the pitty-pat, I'll give him that
The rhythm hit him back with a right hook
Shook it off, caught a shiner, thought it was an aight look
Depends on the shades
The end of days fades, pretenders lay
In dazes on stages, DOO-Malaise
Eat it up, microphone, microwave mayonnaise
His own way was strange but it matters not
Tuned into a frequency tone that shattered rock
Hold it down like Shatner do Spock
Rapper jocks need to put a sock in they chatterbox
The block got light of Vioxx stock
Folks gather round, it's no joke like "Knock, knock"
It's them, they came home to roost y'all
And watch 'em transform the game to the rules of foosball
She's too small, any questions?
Him could squeeze blood from a penny in the recession
Keep guessing, it gets deeper than depression
The power of suggestion wake a sleeper, peep the lesson
Dig that beat
Ripped it with Metal Fingers and stomped it with big fat feet
And you know what they say, cut the hay
Resistance is futile, you will be assimilated, but today
It's all grey, metallic with a ruby stone
Rude like the type of dude you could write a movie on
Hardcore porn, did his own stunts
Writ his own rhymes and split his own blunts
Once, in a while, every other minute
Eyes pop out, Popeye, heavy on the spinach
Steady on his business and ready with a ill pitch
Keeps a bad bilznitch like Denny Kucinilznich
No hitch, just a shit-load of spit and sneeze
Strictly G stacking up off a rack of hidden fees
Rap is like the gay club strip tease
With hippies on the yip saying "Hey bub, grip these"
They screaming for attention
Beaming at the mention of a scary demon convention
You could cut the tension with a switchblade
And serve it on the same plate of hors d'oeuvres a witch made
Filleted, persuaded the chambermaid
To bet her paycheck on a get-naked game of spades
Straight up, no chaser, no layaways
Caution, faint taste of microwave mayonnaise
Doom has taken over every continentFeel the magnetism between us 
Growing stronger and stronger 
Why don't we do it? 
I was in a case out of state
She was thirteen and good, we had a hotter date
It was just a number, she never told she was knocked up
By the end of the summer chick almost had me locked up
My aunt came and got me, and steadied the block
We bounced to the yeti, and I'm ready to rock
With no attachments, feelin a little loose
Blowin up in every spot, we had a little juice
Probably the Dom or the Afghani bud in me
We played the stage standin by the speaker and suddenly...
Who tapped me? I'm bout to get real ill
Already ripped the whole club with Metal Face's steel wheel
What a sweet surprise her with the fly eyes
And fine, she pulled me to the sidelines
The mystery shot up with strong words
She was an intelligent wisdom and a songbird
I met her last week at the same place
She stepped to me, the same way at a no shame pace
I'm off guard, her game had me choked up
Checkin me, play testin me, till I spoked up
Seven whole days and nights and not a word from you 
I was worried, I thought I woulda heard from you
Stranger, you know I never get enough of you
How you be comin through... 
Myself and two a alikes had ran through this crew of three
In my earlier days they showed me things new to me
So we knew mad brothers who they had hit off
They even used to watch each other just to rock they shit off
When slovenly two smile and I'm scopin her
Switchin off three times a night made them more opener
So you could love Allah, or leave him the hell alone
Message from my godfather, solid gold telephone
Many of my men went up in smoke
While trickin with these chickens, and ended up broke
You find out who's ya mans when you broke
Like a bad joke, it's funny, when you on you got mad folk
I played the middle man in every little scam
Some as complex as a hip hop album riddle jam
I find it's quite intriguing as I think about rappers
Walk upon me speaking with they stinkin mouth 
About this and that from sneakers to hats to gats
Freak chicks with the cooty cat raps
And it's that cool the dice at that
I'm at a black tie affair with a diva with the fatty fat
I play the back, steady on the humble
But be right up front when we get ready to rumble
I gave her breath control, ask her who she learned off
Coulda took her back to the crib, somehow was turned off
Me and you... was overdue
From gettin together baby
I always knew our love was meant to be 
Feel the magnetism between us 
Growing stronger and stronger 
Why don't we do it? 
:
 Phantoms, eerie tales of suspense
Yeah, just a phantom anthem
Traveled in a trio, or maybe just abandoned
It's random, found one, take your grandson for ransom
Got 'im with his hands all in the cookie jar
Playin' hooky, gettin' drunk, later on, took your car
Soul Of Mischief: Til infinity, got a bone to pick
And the phantom will forever remain on your shit list
The other one give good advice, well dressed, real nice
Knows your worth, sets the price, keep you out the hood for life
Think that would suffice, but really it's just the beginnin'
Third one got you drunk and high, runnin' round here chasin' women
Wife wonder how you diss fam and disgrace your children
Dudes is wired like that, it's still an all-case buildin'
Drats and double-tracks, shorties with the bubble fats
Ay caramba, trouble jack, phantom steal another track
Bet your life, double that, think you havin' fun in fact
Slip her one too many times, may not be no coming back
 Never let it happen
Lose your phone, tell side-chick, "Get to packin'"
Other phantom write it all down and get to rappin'
I fought a ghost in my apartment, he had too many hitpoints
He bested me and told me I should've invested in Bitcoin
And then he lit joints and offered me a Fanta can
He drove a Phantom then he started singing Phantogram
Well damn, I'm like, "Isn't this convenient?"
It didn't take a genius to sniff it as somethin' fiendish
He introduced himself and said, "What's your name?"
For the next four days, we played the exquisite corpse game
I sold my soul to 'im for some new hightops
Told The Phantom guide my hand and I drew Cyclops
Best wrestlers get possessed to do high spots
Hey, I stay toasty at Smoke and Noob Saibot, yeah
My man was kinda the best ghost
He gifted me a new rap book that's prob'ly ya Death Note
He was the homie though, we shared the same virtues
He showed me his soul once now I only wear church shoes
Turned out he wasn't dead, just very fatigued
My apologies, I buried the lede
I'm real bad at tellin' stories y'all, prob'ly shoulda
Told y'all from the beginning that he wasn't, he wasn't really dead
Why do these phantoms always wind up haunting me? Yeah
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Why do these phantoms always wind up haunting me? Yeah 
Phantoms, phantoms, phantoms, phantoms
Phantoms, phantoms, me, yeah 
Why do these phantoms always wind up haunting me? Yeah
Phantoms, phantoms, phantoms, phantoms
Phantoms, phantoms, haunt-haunt-haunt-haunt
Yo, I used to hop the 3 train, always out for more wax
Smoke blunts with danger, trouble at my doorstep
Stared death in the face, left him with a sore neck
The Devil himself can't resist the raw dialect
Clashed with the titans, robbed stores with Lucifer
Seduced a temptress, threesome with Medusa
The phantoms, they surround me like Dolby sound
Like they seen a live nigga in a ghost town
Never was afraid of the dark, I was goodie man
I learned early, the boogeyman is fam
They say I'm evil, and my mind is twisted
I say I'm godly, my lines is wicked
Haley Joel Osment, I see fake niggas
Gravediggers, goons, trolls, shapeshifters
I always feel like somebody watchin' me
Slayin' demons on the reg, shotgun with Constantine
Fuck a phantom, I'm fed up with phony fantasies
Fake fugazi fantasies fam, we far from family
Foes feelin' free to forge with fetti and fame
They fabricated, fascinating like a Frank Frazetta frame
Fools falsify facts, friends figure it's fine
They fail to, fix the fraudulent and formulate a Frankenstein
For real, your focus fuzzy like footage of The Flash
Or the first pharoah fossil found, fetch a flask
Force it  down fast, cause flood's in the forecast
You don't know a fraction, forget the half
Follow, your financial future's finished
Phantom's got you free-fallin' for females and fish for the fictitious
Why do these phantoms always wind up haunting me? Yeah
Phantoms, phantoms, phantoms, phantoms
Phantoms, phantoms, me, yeah
Why do these phantoms always wind up haunting me? Yeah
Phantoms, phantoms, phantoms, phantoms 
Phantoms, phantoms, haunt-haunt-haunt-haunt 
Phantoms, phantoms, phantoms, phantoms
Phantoms, phantoms, haunt-haunt-haunt-haunt-haunt-haunt-haunt-hauntTo my Metal Face bros with stomachs of cast iron
Who been in to win and blast to the last siren
On the slow-mo the calm artist with the so-so chick
Chased them all like how he did to Slobodan Milosevic
Anyhoo, how 'bout them Yankees?
Once I leave off-stage the party people thanks mee's
If I may speak freely nasty like the freaky-deeky
At your local sleazy speakeasy
For any fan of the limelight
In the mic stand was left a lit stick of dynamite
It's risky business like hand-to-hand crack sale
With rappers who's better off on the cover of Black Tail
Jumpin Jehoshaphat, who's that?
Who cats who do magic be like "Tell me how you do's that"
Heck no, especially those who cop pleas like Gecko
Let go the mic, do techno
Ha ha, betcha bust out laughing at the bet
For no reason he get cussed out like Tourette's
Yet tight flow to make her bad ass stutter
Or even crack a smile from a mad fast cutter
But uh... word play since third grade age
Back when we used to play "Bang! Open bird cage"
Hip hop Benny Hill, Sip Henny straight
Get every penny, wait, then he chill, at any rate
My metal face hoes with tongue or 'least eye ring
Do yourself, I will continue to do my thing
Like Kung-Fu fighting everybody was biting
Then the super-villain struck again like lightning
In the same spot  now what's the chance of that?
And a name drop like pick the name out the hat
Thats a no jiver from the liver conniver
Who vote player out the rap game like Survivor while I
Drop degrees like a nerd cat, willy intense speech
From way back to spin your back and then freeze
While I play high-ball, low-ball, to zero
So called rhymers, go call Cleo
While I, steal the show like "thought so, try hikin"
Super-duper stars need Ortho Tri-Cyclen
Sometimes the men, mostly from the women
I hear voices saying that's the super-villain
Mostly from the women, I hear voices... super-villainMore rhymin', pure diamond, tore hymen, poor timing
Raw lining, Paul Simon touring, I'm in
Boring typing, snoring pipe when hyper than four hypemen
Excited writing, trifling times ten
Long stay, songs play, gone haywire, wrong way
On the interstate, integrate all day
It's just a small phase, that's what them all say
Then fall prey in a mini-mall hallway
Meant to be sold, not told to friendly enemies
Remember these intentionally, empathy please
Silent moment, violent prone atonement
Miles a minute on a microphone, own rent, loan spent
No debt, has bet, fast get, cash jet
Master McSmash, Asterix stashed it last
Not least, pass the pot of hot grease
Geese shot, not easily spotted plot, cease snot release
Hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well
Or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail
Get the message by bird mail or turds flail
Villain man, best nerd male you heard wail
An absurd tale of books, nooks and crannies
Before she look, he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties
Or plan B, when in Rome, go back home
And get real dome from a well-known crack gnome
He talk to himself when he need someone to hate on
The black McCain campaign, negative debate-a-thon
Gone wrong on the song
Who's zooming who? Knew it was you DOOM all along
Ever since he first started the art, it's been worth it
Soon to charter a stint on part of the Chitlin' Circuit
Word kid, get your ticket from the telepath
"Wicked, wicked, wicked" on electroencephalograph
Villain, nice to meet you
{​​*snore*}​​ You born like this?Uh-uh
Hiking in the sun the happiness that you mourn
You know the kids still dance, so we supply all the songs
If I'm wrong, you hit the superman like Soulja at war
You grew your hair an inch longer for the clerk at the store
Growing up man, Pokémons in book bag
Can't you believe it if the panties never soaking
You said Jesus made sense to the chosen
If I'm wrong, the shell's stuck beneath the sides that you're on
To choose the quickest solution don't equate to your flaws
I know my black hearts sinking to the bottom of soles
I know my cheese stinks sitting by your highness in vogue
Ch-Ch-Chicken Little, who you telling secrets to, bro?
The pain made a new summer where the vegetables grow
We get it on , do the grown stuff, now play with this sword 
You know what I'm saying
Twistin' indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in the blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day-ay, oh-oh-oh, yeah
The power you've given me
The crack of dawn sweet cheer to the clipped wing
The planes fly and we the youngest in the stampede
To climb the slippery slope a decade old of doing me
L-L-Look, I got the black man balled in my fist
You laugh now, cry later, just empower the kids 
Growing pains, monsters all under my bed
Sweats when you sweating me, you looking real cute
You got a dimple under eyes, I bet you never knew
You look the thickest I've seen since the last time
Got us tickets for the show by the alibi
And all the things, all the things, all the days that we scorned
I can fly, I'm a dove, I'm a butterfly, yo 
I'm a butterfly, yo, fuck 
Twistin' indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in the blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day-ay, oh-oh-oh, yeah
It's inadequate, this elaborate floral display
They paid for bad habits, gaul and moral decay
To say what's unforgiveness, it'll all go away
Lay a plot to book a yacht out on the water today, porque
Is it so compelling, the rebel with all the yelling?
Now it's overwhelming, you're swelling melon, bruh, who you telling?
Dumb lust overflowing in love stuff, hush
Heart crushed like a bag of dust, bum rush
Black beanie, freak out at night like Whodini
Creep out the back and
Who coulda seen a G, easily, blue weenie
She couldn't dig it if it was too teeny
Bless her with the kundalini and plus the zucchini
Always been a plan to mush a heart melt, bird
It takes a steady hand to push these heartfelt words
I heard you heard, trapped in delirium
Thoughts of a queen to throw off your equilibrium
A few jokes, but the underlying fact goes
It’s still a ray of hope to live happily ever after though
Disaster's what I asked her for
Now we stuck like plaster, yo, I has to go
Twistin' indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in the blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day-ay, oh-oh-oh, yeahGumbo!
You gotta watch your gums on this
But it's, it's very good, it's very healthy
You would only want to use the wraps when there's no food associated with the use of the wraps
So, uh, some potential uses include, um, wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
And in that case, the, the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked, cooked your meats
Um, there's also been interest in, um, development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap and consume it that way the next day
(It's hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
Create a new demand for produce
Stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
And eat more chitlins)Live in stereo!
Yessir! This what I wanna hear my nigga, yeah
Yeah yeah 
You don't even know that's the official word up in the town
You heard?  hahaha 
Get that swing  get it in man

What are you going to rap about?
Yeah, when niggas was rhymin hard and comin crazy
Electrifying and vivid  yo
I'm like a rabbi, fresh new mag and I'm mad high
Stolen black Jag, I brag fly, yeah
Yo, a project thug, political gangster, starving Langston Hughes
The Jews want the crib when the God dies
I'm deadly, metaphors'll dog you
While I'm in the Forbes, first 500 niggas who raw live
Yo B, the nigga Shallah, he low-key
But he O.G., half of his niggas gone or in hidin
Federales'll sneak, police, holdin my old piece
Heard the young policeman died
58 carats of glass, the Aston blueberry black
Where I keep my ices and knives at
One of the force rawest
Yo, we're British aware who get money, shoot dice in his fortress
Mocknecks and stragglers
Eightball jackets the hagglers of the rap game, post up, surprise
I want that spot
Coolin with the Supervillain team, all you other playboys is twats
Niggas be down for the murder game
Run in the church, grab the rifle, put one in a nigga frame
I'm thirsty, hungry like a Somalian
Prol'ly with them niggas with the waves in they dome like tsunami
All we do is get fresh and fuck ma probably
Yo' baby mother gave me head in Barney's while I calmly
And I got giants in armies
While we rock mean colored clothes and don divas
Yeah, Chef back, some call him Louis Smith
Slash Lex Diamond and his chick sell crack
We rep bananas, beat this, legend of Stan Smith
700 dollar jeans, keepin your man distance
Yeah son, gimme your ear son
Yo yo yo, yo yo get the fuck away from the ropes man
Fuckin' chicken, ha ha ha
Doom, the warning signal again, somebody approaches!
What manner of creatures are these? There they are again, FIRE!
A gunshot from inside the house, forces a change of plans
Okay, let's make sure all the windows are covered
A straightforward entry has turned
Into what appears to be a barricaded standoff
POLICE DEPARTMENT! COME TO THE FRONT DOOR!
Anything you say, cracker
As the funky beat continuesWhat rhymes with shillin? Villain
What rhymes with shmillain? Villain
He's a villain, yes he is
Set it off, adrenaline rush
The boys way beyond a pen and a Dutch
Stronger than Henn, a bag of the dust
You need to watch how they acting with us
Now time to get it in gear
You can get it in right here
Revenge is better than beer
Yo DOOM, it's been a minute, think they getting it clear 
When brothers reunite 
Make sure we party right 
We rock it all night long
Even beyond the morning light 
It's hard to see him in the light
Even harder to see him on the mic
A black Benz beats being on a bike
And he can talk a gay chick outta being a dyke
Like that y'all 
Freak freak y'all, to the beat y'all 
Keep it on click fully auto
I won't stop the rock 'til pockets thick and gordo
More so a risk of sounding poor, bro
No tux, who needs tickets to the award show?
Normally cordial
More or less, less is more or no
 Hock spit out the cockpit
Stuck to the window 'til it's solid as a rock hit
Yes, he is
He grabbed the mic like two money bags
Waiting for the getaway to count what he had
Thought he was a spaz, but dude kept wrecking
The crowd remote control, keep 'em all guessing
Funny man gave 'em nothin' like a bummy dare
Taught him how to fight wit' a mic and the hottest stab
But that's the life of a villain
And you know after that, chilling
Went places, God Gracie, don't follow
The big joke, ain't no Cola in the Coke bottle
Writing rhymes 'til the pen go hollow
And been flow hotter than the sunshines of Marrow
It's just the villainous scheme
If not real life, it's still in yo' dreams
Like that y'all, like that y'all
Like that, a-like that and like that y'all
What rhymes with thrillin? Villain
What rhymes with stealin? Villain
He's a villain, yes he is
That's right, I'll smack the black off of ya punk!
Villain, pushin' on the couch cushion
Southside Minneap', never lived out in Brooklyn
Kept the faith, forget the fame
If they sweat the name, let it set the lane
Held mind, cold and hard
Had no regard who the chosen are
Who, you? Oh no
You played the oboe, keep it on the low low
Rappers are candy, butterscotch
I'ma let their baby mothers watch
She loves the ock, I touch the spot
Bitch, I'm the itch that must've got up her crotch, heh
Now stop, fill the buildings
Leave some pills for these little villains
Hey shorty, share the flask
Let me explain why I wear this mask
Villain!
I want you to call me at that address if I'm still there
Gonna make sure you get cracked!Whenever I'm expecting a lot of company
Haven't had a lot of company in a long time
But if I were expecting some
I'd whip up a really  substantial meal
You see how strong I am? 
It's from eating all this stuff
Good healthy meal like the...fillet
Now that's what they call...soul food
Now you got black-eyed peas
Carrot greens
Collard greens
Cornbread
Watermelon
And for dessert
Pork butts
Eat heartily gentlemen
I got a really stressful day and I really really needed some food
Something healthy like beets
Showed you how good it is
Well you may say "I don't think I'd care for that"
So you could also fix yourself a...When this reporter babe get here, she gon' be on our tip, man. You know she gon' wanna write about me and my man here, all kind of long articles and stuff.

Top Secret Ultra End Of Message
Um
Huh
Now, who will be the first to tell me of a past adventure?
I ain’t sayin’ nothing
Why don’t you tell him about the time we faced Doom?
Alright. Well as I remember, Doom had threatened the world leaders with destruction of every major city on earth. *Telephone Rings*
Headquarters
Good evening
Would you believe it? It’s Doom on the phone!
What’s on your evil mind?
Hold your insulting tongue and mark my words well. I have plotted my revenge on you. Now I shall have it! Bid farewell to your friends!
Doom hates us all, but in his warped mind, he has a personal score to settle with me
Operation DoomsdayTheir instructor is speaking
Eatin' Captain Crunch for lunch, don't get your panties in a bunch
Shorty passed out, he coulda put the whammy in the punch
Had he a hunch, he could get set up like one Cosby
Slidin' off of three snowflakes like Tom Bosley
Remember Charlie's Angels? They had to make some changes
Three broads with burners, these dames could get dangerous
Dude you never see will forever remain nameless
Two of them things is black, the last one's stainless
Don't deal with the Devil on a deep level
They see metal and sound off like a tea kettle
Blow the spot up lovely
With no reference to skin color, God don't like ugly
Wise man once said not to showboat
And treat the yacht the same way as a rowboat 
The snakes'll hang theyself with they own rope
And watch a jewel transform to a known quote
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Throw a mask on and go in
What's Mary Poppin', y'all? Shout to Michael Rooker
You with a mic is like a eunuch with a hooker
Pressure  cooker
My Konfusion's Organized, I'm the lord of light
Yondu with an arrow's like Eso with the cordless mic
Flow holy, no gospel trap, writin' like
Michael Crichton put the rap in Velocirap-tor, or
I hit you like a trap, door, when it rains it pours
No mental strains but I, stick out like Kurt Angle's temple veins
You got an empty brain, enter in my lane
It takes balls like a gender change, people talkin' out they ass
Check for the double-cross like 2 Chainz at Sunday mass
Hit you with the belly to belly, the suplex
Off the roof of the duplex, willin' to group text
With Steely Dan, Groot, fuckin' baby Groot, the ghost of Dave Brubeck
Alex Trebek and Boba Fett, who's next?
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Throw a mask on and go in
They can't handle the pressure, tryn'a handle Inspectah
'Cause I eat 'em up faster than Hannibal Lecter
Couldn't plan it no better, try me, you know better
I will fuck money up, Spike Lee in "Mo' Better"
Choose your battles more wisely, I wouldn't suggest you provoke
I stunt your growth like cigarette smoke
 I'm talkin' effortless flow
I tell the truth, the whole truth, so let the record show
I went from corner to corner, took it block to block
Came from under the rock, rock bottom to top
It's like New York City cab style, picture me stopped
They gon' catch it like a fish when it officially drop
Just pre-order the slaughter, when you give it a listen
There'll be so many bars, we'll give you visions of prisons
So many haters among us, though I never surrender
I'm like Jeremy Renner, silent weapon, Avenger
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Look out, run through your town on attack mode
Throw a mask on and go in
They call him CZARFACE, and man's worst enemy
CZARFACE head on with one of the meanest mugs
In the galaxy: the Chrome Bearer
Make sure your hoodie is on, and your boots laced
This adventure will keep you at the edge of your seat
CZARFACE, the baddest one man army to hit town
Always where the action is
CZARFACE, rated R
Under 17 not permitted without parental supervisionUsual suspects again 
Mr. Black  Mr. Brown 
Mr. Irish  Mr. Greek 
We been at it for hours 
We searched this whole industry 
And we couldn't find no dope 
I mean, there's no fuckin' dope 
They love me 'cause I talk my shit
They love me more 'cause I walk my shit
War with the gift, score with it, Jordan assists
Shorter blip, beat the beat, stick a fork in this shit
Don't trip, forfeit, it's the Brothers Grimm
Yo, how they kill a body and still party like it wasn't them?
Fire supplier, droppin' game like I'm Urban Meyеr
The sire leavе your eyes wider than Suburban tires
Rebel the great, whatever it takes
No pressin' the brakes, you hate? You could never debate
I'm settin' ya straight, wait, no scale could measure the weight
The bottom line is your head on a plate, mate 
I pull strings like I'm playin' the harp
I really live it, you just playin' the part
Make way for the shark, I'm colder, strictly business is the soldier
Steady knockin' like a witness of Jehovah 
Metal mask, get harassed, say it's true, forget the past
Bring your liquor, get the flask, tap your cigarette to ash
Feel it quicker, get to blast, this is sicker than this trash
Guard my ninjas in the cash, you begin to bet the stash
Chicken dinners, up to task, toes pressin' on your throat
Wonderin', "Is this the end?" Good question, you know who
On a better note, better than racketeerin', sellin' dope
Not obvious, present a risk like bending down to get the soap 
That kinda separates me from everybody else
You know, my mask, so, I love it
Look at this freakin' loaf of bread
That my buddy Piero baked today
Holy shit 
I can see clear in the dark, beauty, Imperial March
All my material sharp, that's how I tear 'em apart
I'm magic like Houdini, my gambit down low but no Luccini
Hoodied up like Jawa, Utinni, rest look like Blue Meanie
People likin' me to question, nobody can truly see me
When it comes to rap, I'm as brutal as Mussolini
My patience wearing thin, I'm Ratjakowski at arenas
Sorta, Joaquin Phoenix, remix of the Joker
Listen, it's bulimic, a demon, Barbera steez how I part the seas
If they speakin' like they Mola Ram, without heart to squeeze
Barely sleepin' 'cause they heart disease
Your arteries are filled with bars, the beats and every mark a P
I swear they all unique, I'm David Harbour meets a Marley beat
The way I get biz and give 'em hell, boy
Leave you in the dirt like Barry Larkin cleats, spaced out
Like how a Martian speaks
Ironic, how you sound like a salesman when you rockin'
When in fact, it's me who had zero interest in what you're droppin'
Or concocted, unlock it, so stick a sock in it, I'm dominant
Like Tyson Fury boxin', I'm prominent
Yo, I heard your crew was poppin' shit, but now, not so often
I caught 'em and I made 'em cry
Like ads for dog adoption from Sarah McLachlan
The pharaoh was talkin', people want 'em
The beats beat the freaks, so Bleeker Street don't need to scorn 'em
I kill the track, it's still intact, so why you playin' possum?
I download packs and red lines, I thought you knew I'm awesome
I have no idea what you said but I'm pretty sure it's awesome
What?
What?
And if you idiots out there don't know what that is
I'm not gonna tell yaI'll show the world, and more particularly those dim-witted, no-talent studio execs, that I— I'll prove that I'm the greatest soundman of all time!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm wit' it
He was a recording genius who invented this gizmo that turns bells into bombs, or something!
Wow. Gotta get outta the way of the soundwaves of those bells
Who got the most whips, gats and cash?
If you ask the villain, he say, "Who gives a rat's ass?"
Can't take it wit'choo you when you breathe your last
In the meaning in between "pass that grass"
Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank
He often time drank by the river bank
And kept a silver shank; for a calm cat
Always stayed strapped for hand-to-arm combat
For DOOM the bell tolls
Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes
It's filled up to the brim with sold souls
Crackheads, dope fiends and 40s of ol' gold
Hold up, the boldest who ever sold it
Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded
Like Holly Hobbie, gosh golly gee
The back of Hector Hoskerish's trolly read "Wash me" 
Dagnabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet
Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit
They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett
A fiend for the mic and can't kick it like a sick habit 
Give him a hero's holla
Along wit' more free dough than Creflo Dollar
Holy Toledo, how he made base on The Today Show?
They say he wear a mask in case his face show
It's better than a stocking, birdbrain
Find him on the corner rockin' Mockingbird Lane
He's a odd man, Grandma
And she's a bad mamma-jamma; either squeeze the damn hammer
Or stop complainin', on the top he's remainin'
A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin'
The people say he's the nicest
He only wants to be left alone, to his own devices
If the price is right, he might sing a new smash
Then laugh 'n twist his Rollie Fingers moustache
Tear ya crew a new.. gash
And prepare a new batch of his own special herb goulash
Villain, the dork who talk funny
And'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk, money
Like Semy say, do more boomers, they cure tumors
And beware the Doomsta!
The bells toll for you! Ha, ha, ha, ha...Okay, okay
Okay , okay 
Soul surviving, DOOM's so conniving
Never stop driving, they pussy like a hymen
Don't let 'em sit behind you when you driving
Might even think you talking about 'em when you rhyming
Oughta keep his toolie in the lining
Oughta thank the good Lord that you ain't the type zip to line 'em
Ain't nobody in business, why they always spyin'?
Type of shit is this? Find nothin', get to lyin'
Turn the world against you, even your mens buyin'
It's a dirty game, get hectic, real tiring
Top it off, now they playing victim and the violin
Dripping the color envy, more greener than Ireland
Surrounded by snakes more mеaner than a lion's den
You're talking too much, can't rеmember why or when
Got you feelin guilty, Jedi tricks on the mind again
Make you eat a dick with chips and a Heineken
Action— As I continue where we left off
Break— As I continue where we left off
Action— As I continue where we left off
The rebel, the villain, the rebel, the— CZAR
People saying CZAR like ASMR
The Cold Crush on repeat, now we rock the Casbah
E-S back at 'em, savage like Black Adam
Fast track in the back and forth to blast at 'em
You ain't worthy, so you don't get no reply
We keep an open eye, we kick it like Cobra Kai
And we the crew leading, I wouldn't
Remotely care about you even if we in a Zoom meeting
Let's be honest, yo, these rappers just a boring mess
Actors oughta thank the Hollywood foreign press
CZARFACE, yeah, we slap up obnoxious kids
Take 'em out on tape like unboxing vids
Lay 'em out like a floor plan
Sick of playing optimistic like I'm in Thom Yorke's band
You lost your mystique and leaked on 4chan for your four fans
Your aura gone, no Portland
Action— As I continue where we left off
Break— As I continue where we left off
Action— As I continue where we left off
I'll give you credit for givin' a try
Last name Lannister, call me Kingslayer
None this ill since Kareem was a Laker
Feel that love? Yeah, that's the dream of a hater
I'm skatin' the equator, last seen in Jamaica
Frontin' like the girl dem sugar
Rude boi dem ah call Inspectah
Got 'em under pressure, no gas, word to Tesla
You'll find the painkillers top drawer in the dresser
Back with the force, y'all, BoJack Horseman
All that talkin, you know that cost him
High price to pay like you shopped at Nordstrom
Deck narcoleptic, I black out often
Salute me as a true king, what up with you, king?
I been doing this since Zhané had a groove thing
Another mood swing, touching up your boo thing
CZARFACE, Wu-Tang, MF DOOM, gang
I know, it's— it's— it's basically
It's all cuts— cuts— cuts and stuffViktor, any ideas?
We came, we came
We came, we came, we came
We came, we came 
We came, we came, we came
DOOM, what you think of them? 
They're mostly all on dork mode, molder than pork glow
Foretold, feed 'em a whole fork load
More bones that are old in front the store where it's more cold
Made more gold probably than all the box of horse show
Copped, threw some rocks up under the door mold
Fiend picked the lock, squat, shit was a foreclose
Villain, more action than triple X pornos
One fall through the crack, he comin' back to get all those
They lying, straight faced, they attack with a long nose
You can't change that  how the song goes
Thicker than the spinners with dudes who drawing pinners
Of dirt weed, under the envelopes, tinfoil TV dinners
We're all beginners, touch soil in the winter
Stash box of fresh Timbs, top grill, all glimmer
Shine burn your eye if you try to fly
Chameleon turn to fry if you burn the pie, bye
D-O-P-E, and I'm gonna show you how
Don't you DOOM
D-O-P-E, and 
On his tip toes, no less, and he's hammered
The session bent with the stench of excess hemp
He so fire, check his temp, I represent like Shawn Kemp
Due is paid, no Detlef, shout to Schrempf
I'm a pacer, mind-eraser
Money chaser, 7L track lacer
My whole camp fire, something like a Webelo
And even though your words go unheard like the T in Pinot Grigio
I gotta cut you short like the 2020 season bro
Loyalty is second nature like breathing is
But trust could be a plus, see some allegiances
Could be as deceiving as cleavage is
Put it together where the fake, we'll see how deep it is
How GiGi Hadid it is
I do lead the league in this, now I got the key to this
Culture like a Petri dish, shit, don't let me speak to this kid
Who ain't half as hard, living a rap facade
Want CZAR? Cut the check like stabbing a cat from Prague
We came, we came
Don't you 
And he's hammered
On his tip toes no less, and he's hammered
You don't stop
One, two in the place, you don't stop 
CZARFACE 
One, two in the place, you don't stop 
Super what?
Every hero needs an action figure
And when it's CZARFACE, it has to be super
Super What? Super Seven
Be sure to grab the brand new CZARFACE reaction retro figure
Available at SuperSeven.com
Boom, boom, boom, bang, bang, bangYou've been workin' on music, since 
Ever since I've known you
Shit! Ahahahah
Ayo, that's how he was rhymin', man, I don't give a fuck
And you were like, "You're dead to me" 
That's the beginnin'? 
Okay, okay
And it came to pass
That the gods, the superpowered beings 
And the extraterrestrials all came together in concert
And they had one purpose
And that purpose was to save some lives
So that you, no matter what you was goin' through
Would survive 
I take the mic' from D
And that's the only way to set off such a CZAR-studded LP
The bass hits like base hits, I'm Aaron Judge
First you're scary thugs, next you call five like Karen does
The Feds, they get weird, protect your neckbeard
My head is clear like Shakespeare when he wrote King Lear
Listen, all that "comin soon" shit? Stop it
Your project's like a topic of discussion with my girl
'Cause I know you'll never drop it
Plus you're standin' there like Orange Cassidy
With your hands in your pockets, the audacity
Breakin' necks when I flex like X-23
I pass the mic' back to the king, D.M.C., get 'em
D.M.C. in the place to be
Darryl makes comics just like Stan Lee
Like Peter Parker, I live in Queens
And like T'Challa, I am a king
What have we got, Viktor?
That's a, that's a, that's a pretty good question
We have the mask
He has got the mask, the mask, the mask
The mask, the mask, the mask, the mask 
The mask, the mask, the mask, the mask
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
The mask, the mask, the mask, the mask
The mask, the mask, the mask, the mask
It's that CZARFACE shit
You know, all of us have...
So to speak, and we need someone to listen
What an unexpected surprise
You wanna roll this tape? 
Alright, let's go, let's go ahead and roll this tape
Roll him outta here
This mask, and you, I know it can have a serious effect on my lifestyle tooKeep it movin'
I'm from the era that started the park wars
I beat box, pop-and-lock, B-boys spinnin' on cardboard
Graffiti Rock, Beat Street, Breakin', and Style Wars
Above the Rim, Brown Sugar, Belly, and CB4
Watch me drop a Wild Style on a Krush Groove
My Hustle & Flow, I'm sure to get Paid in Full
That's the Rhyme & Reason, so pardon me
Who's the Man with the Juice that crashed the House Party?
They just Baller Blockin', 'cause I'm Notorious
No stoppin' me 'til I'm dead or State Property
How High can you fly over New Jack City?
Look up, Friday, I Got the Hook Up
I'm hip-hop's Most Wanted, comin' Straight Outta Park Hill
Call 'em Idlewild, my bars ill
Get Rich or Die Tryin', but Never Die Alone
Love to my Boyz n the Hood, I'm Ghost, Dog
 Shhh, don't spoil it
